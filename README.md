###The story: 

When you connect your GoPro camera to your android device and use the GoPro app while doing something, you may have noticed that the buttons are small (even on my Nexus 6 display) and to access the settings there is too much tapping.

Also, it takes a while to connect and it disconnects when you close the app. It's a pain to go to the app, tap on Control, tap that little button to see the media in the camera, tap the last pic and download it. 

This is my attempt to reduce the friction and make a buttery smooth experience when controlling your camera with your phone. Featuring big nice buttons with colors so you just need to see the color and tap it, use the volume rocker to start/stop video and take pics! Volume up button starts a video/takes a pic. Volume down stops a video/timelapse.

Also, three main resolutions are added to simplify the process of configuration.

It features material design, something the GoPro app does not have.

The app is free, and it will work with all GoPro WiFi enabled cameras (HD2 with WiFi BacPac, HERO3, HERO3+, HERO4)

You can add more features by forking and pushing requests.

The app will have constant updates and new features, because I am very active.

####Todo: 

Using [scrum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVksFviJVE) it makes software development much more effective and faster
